# Mail-Server-Scripts
Scripts to configure+integrate open-source & free components/software, into a free & open-source (single/cluster) mail-server.

Patch-scripts to modify+configure existing open-source mail server project scripts: iRedMail+iRedAdmin, Mail-in-a-Box, etc.

Check our "Wiki" sub-site under this project.
<br /><br />

We had to start this prject because many mail-server projects/devs are using open-source & free & derived knowledge/scripts, but putting them only in "Paid" editions, instead of making it available for free in open-source edition, so such projects/devs are either violating license or doing injustice.
