# Server-Admin-Scripts
Scripts to configure+integrate open-source & free components/tools/software, into a free & open-source web/mail/DNS/IM, etc (single/cluster) server.

Patch-scripts to modify+configure existing open-source (web/mail/etc) server project scripts:<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;Virtualmin, Usermin, Webmin, iRedMail+iRedAdmin, Mail-in-a-Box, etc.

Check our "<a href="https://github.com/atErik/Server-Admin-Scripts/wiki">Wiki</a>" sub-site under this project.
<br /><br />

We had to start this project because many mail-server projects/devs are using open-source & free knowledge/scripts & which is derived from other/many free & open-source knowledge/scripts/projects , but putting them only in "Paid" editions, instead of making it available for free in open-source edition, so such projects/devs are either violating license or doing injustice.
